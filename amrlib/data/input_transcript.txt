'Hello.',
'Hello.',
'Yeah, yeah.',
'Yeah, you know.',
'Okay.',
'Yeah, I think this is better.',
'Yeah something with my laptop for sure.',
"I don't know what I like.",
"Now you're consistently stano.",
'You still go on and off your in and out of this meeting?',
"What do you mean like it's the name is flickering?",
'Yeah.',
"Oh, that's really weird.",
'Okay, let us just try it out.',
'I do see the transcripts are all working fine.',
"Yeah, and I can see you're their service joining in second.",
'So.',
"We can restart again if that's okay.",
'Yeah, we will have to restart it.',
'Let us restart.',
'Oh my God.',
'Okay.',
'Hey, we made it.',
"God I don't was ok.",
'Cool now that you guys are here.',
"So what's up?",
'Yeah.',
"So here's the agenda that I thought we would be able to cover today.",
'Now.',
'So let us start with the company update and then get into sales update.',
'And then after that towards the end, we will cover any CX updates and after that open Flow.',
'Does it sound good?',
'True.',
'Yeah, that sounds good.',
'Right.',
'Okay, cool.',
'I can just do some very quick updates of specifically.',
'Like or last quarter.',
'I think it was just give me a second.',
'Okay, I am pulling out.',
'I am just pulling out my notes.',
'Just to make sure that I kind of like talk through what I am supposed to talk about.',
'Yeah.',
'What is it called?',
'Its called?',
'Oh, yeah.',
'I know what it is called.',
'Sorry about that.',
'Yeah, I had this weird issue of not remembering exactly.',
'What am I supposed to pull out?',
"Yeah, it's like note-taking is crazy.",
'Yeah.',
'Okay, cool.',
'Well awesome.',
'So just very quick update.',
'So I think we just announced are some of the financial results of the third quarter.',
'Right?',
'So I think we delivered another quarter of the incredible growth at a scale with Revenue growth of 75 percent year-over-year every company needs to focus.',
"Hassan bowling create digital experiences for their customers and I think we're becoming the modern customer engagement platform that can actually add conversation Intelligence on literally every channel of communication.",
'Which is kind of like opening up a new era of data which never existed before our we are going to have a big conference in the next quarter which I think that our announcements there will further Drive the vision of the company and the future that we are feeling towards overall.',
'I can just talk through some of the financial highlights that are very critical for I think all of us on this call to be acquainted with especially when talk about our external stakeholders.',
'Our total revenue was 295 million for the third quarter.',
'It was out by 75% from the third quarter of the last year and seven percent sequentially.',
'Last year and seven percent sequentially from the second quarter of 2019 total revenue includes the revenue from some of our API offerings and the aggregated bi dashboards that we had started releasing at the early of this year.',
'That you guys are already aware of which is the apis sdks and the bi dashboard that we released any questions so far, or I can just keep going specifically towards the new introductions and the key metrics and the recent business highlights if you guys are interested roll deeper.',
'Do you guys want me to continue going?',
'Yes.',
'Yes continue.',
'Yeah.',
'On second thoughts.',
'So yeah, go for it.',
'I do have a question.',
'Yeah, so what are our next quarter goals?',
'So I think next quarter.',
'We are targeting at least 80 percent increase in our Revenue targets.',
'In our Revenue targets.',
"We have been doing a tremendous Revenue increase quarter by quarter, and we need to be able to continue it over exceed our expectations which lands us at somewhere around 400 million and that's really what we were expecting.",
'Awesome.',
'In terms of yeah, in terms of some of the product releases that we are looking at you guys already know that we currently have 2676 employees as of September 30th of 2019.',
'Great.',
'Right?',
'And so and this quarter we bumped that up by 30% And so next quarter.',
'We are looking to an employee expansion by almost 20% again a contributing to the new offerings that we would be releasing shortly.',
'Those are my parts.',
'Yeah.',
'Yeah, so I think my objective for this call was basically the employee growth that we want to be aligned that so that we can implement the practices that we want to for expansions best specifically in global economies.',
'We have a big presence in India at the moment, and we want to be able to expand it to Philippines China.',
"Japan primarily shop Civic and then also grow towards the Eastern side of the states which we haven't been able to do so far.",
"So I want to make sure that we are aligned to the kind of growth in the employee count that we're looking at and put together the right processes to be able to execute that from a revenue standpoint Vikram because you're being spearheaded that initiative overall to the company.",
'And I want to make sure that you understand the goals correctly and put together the right processes that we need to track this on a weekly basis.',
'So yeah, I would really like you to come back with me come back to me with kind of like a framework that we can carry on to track this execution on a weekly basis so that we can see the results that we want to and make sure that we are on track for it.',
'Sure.',
'Sure.',
'I am done.',
'Do you want me to set up a weekly follow-up with you and include the leadership team on that?',
'I think let us do a monthly follow-up and you can touch base with me directly on a weekly basis.',
'But all this other stakeholders, let us do a monthly.',
'Okay, sounds good ever.',
'Okay, cool.',
'Or just coordinate with the admin, and she can set something up for us.',
'Sounds perfect.',
'Okay, great.',
'Cool.',
"So that's pretty much it from my side.",
"I think my main goal was like I said before make sure that we align on the revenue targets that we want to achieve the what we're doing right now you guys already know about it, and then they increase the employee County specifically that we can't the countries that we want to increase that count in and obviously our presence.",
'So yeah, I would love to hear more about like what you guys have been thinking in terms of achieving these targets and then as well.',
'Other issues that we wanted to surface here and this conversation.',
'Yep, sounds good.',
'Well, I can provide a quick high level view an executive summary and dig deeper into the updates and the ideas that we are we have been brainstorming.',
'So at a very high level I think we as a company feel really good about ourselves again, we have the entire Playbook the pricing the Partnerships and B2B as well as direct synapse all of these channels.',
'Have been firing pretty well for us.',
'We have been seeing consistent growth across all of these channels and the team really knows how to get the momentum behind, you know of the initiatives and goes so overall we are in a great shape as it comes to the Google Earth besides locking down the pressing.',
"They're also working on some highly targeted specific account based marketing initiative, and we are seeing a consistent Improvement in terms of our brand recognition as well.",
'So we have done some surveys and The band recall especially with the new name.',
'It has been sticking much more and people have a hideko value.',
"So overall we're saying good numbers on the brand are NPS Our NPS score is consistently again improving.",
'I know we started at a very high number itself over 50.',
'We have been seeing a consistent growth in that number than well.',
"So that's been more than fair this Factory overall from.",
'Let me pause here for a second.',
'Here.',
'We come because I want to hear it from Canal.',
"He's been working a lot on the customer side and like well, you are telling me the quantitative analysis of the feedback that you're getting from 20s and all he is doing a lot of Engagement from a qualitative standpoint so good.",
'Now what is your take on validating the quantitative NPS score, is it really the true NPS?',
"Is it from a small dataset or what's your feedback then?",
"So yeah, it's a good question over the last two weeks.",
'I have been working with multiple customers really trying to drive customer adoption of our product.',
"And obviously we were performing pretty well as a company and as an example, I am working with one of our customers Mac Pai on this custom integration that they're looking for and the process has been going pretty smoothly, and they're really like enjoying working with us as a company.",
"They really see the value we're bringing to them so Along the same lines that vikram's talking about that the NPS scores and customer adoption is peeking at new levels",
'No, your voice is breaking a little bit and between can you just repeat the couple of last sentences that you were saying?',
'Yeah, sorry, so I was saying that while I am working with some of these customers on this custom implementations.',
"It definitely sounds like they have a positive view of our company and the value we're providing them.",
"So whatever vikram's talking about with high NPS scores.",
"I think that's very valid and because I have had the same experience working in person with our end users.",
'Got it.',
'Yeah, you broke out a little bit but I think we saw what you said because of the transcription.',
'I mean the body was breaking but the transcription was there, so I could see it.',
'Okay, awesome.',
"Okay, so like tell me some of the instances where you're still feeling that there is a there is some kind of friction and adoption I think specifically and I would love to hear more and if you could elaborate further.",
'On the same specific examples because that will tie back to what kind of feedback are we getting from?',
'Those other channels other digital channels and if it is a right way to even gather that feedback.',
'Yeah, totally.',
'So one kind of feedback that I have with working with some of our customers is that with Magpie specifically?',
"We have been working through our Sprint Cycles achieving lot of the features that we need a release but a lot of times what happens is that they need something really custom that our product doesn't provide.",
'So I am spending my own bandwidth and going in and manually kind of helping create this custom instance for them.',
"So I am what you know, I would love to get some opinions or feedback on how we can kind of mitigate this friction because it's taking away Cycles from me where else I could be helping other customers achieve more out of their day-to-day processes.",
"Yeah, you're breaking out so much.",
'I can barely hear your voice.',
"I don't know.",
'But okay.',
'Never mind.',
'Yeah, I think we got what you were saying Okay, cool.',
'So would you like to have any like for example changes and the feedback process so far or do you think that most of the feedback crosses that we do right now are adequate to support our customer needs at this point in time?',
'No, I think that we do need to implement some more flows for getting customer feedback.',
'I think one thing is having a direct point of contact through some sort of developer community so that some of these customers that I am working with if they do come across some kind of issue.',
'They can immediately reach directly out to me.',
'And as you know, we a lot of our product team is based abroad.',
'So the time zones has an issue but having like a direct channel to me or other people in the CX Division.',
'I think that would be a good starting point.',
"And you stay would you so, how are you looking at even scaling when you say that you're kind of like developing the community?",
"What are the methods or like the next number of people that you're looking forward to kind of like skill this initiative of having a direct conversation with the customer?",
'So I really want to start bringing on dev Advocate who really love our product who like, you know, would you can use it to the best capabilities and who can really promote what we do?',
'So I want to start identifying those individuals in our existing community and give them some of the power where they can make decisions within a community.',
'Maybe, you know talk about our product talk about events host events.',
'So I think you know, this is a good conversation to have I would love some of your thoughts on how we can approach this problem as well.',
'Yeah, I mean, I am just trying to guess what do you say because you are breaking out a lot.',
"But I think what I hear from you right now is that you want to hire a couple of dev Advocates and you're thinking about the right strategy?",
"And I wouldn't hire them.",
'Is that what you were trying to say?',
"Yeah, that's about right.",
'I really identify those people who really enjoy who really love our product and working with us as a company.',
'Yeah Okay, cool.',
"So I think it's we could look at it from several options and the crumb like feel free to just like give your thoughts here because we want to make sure that when we talk about developers it's not just individual developers but also in developers and big Enterprises and I know you are spearheading all the Enterprise deployments at this one time.",
'So I think we could do like multiple strategies here.',
'The one way is we could hire like full-time developer Advocates and that way they kind of like work with us all days and not just going to events and stuff.',
'But also working on creating an additional layer of adoption, which is needed for our customers to kind of understand that will use cases.',
'The other option is I think could be too just like hire some part-time people across multiple cities.',
'And have them first get a feel of the crowd the kind of Readiness the market has for this kind of advocacy because I am still opinionated about that.',
"I am not very like I don't have a very strong opinion about that because I think it could be a good option, but I am not very sure about having advocacy of full-time into different communities as well.",
'Communications is something that people acknowledge.',
"They do acknowledge the need of it, but I haven't seen a major adoption even in B2B SAS products of any sort of communication Extension, so I mean it is happening, but I am just not evident.",
"I mean, it's just not evident that the speed of which it is happening and what that adoption rate should look like.",
'Yeah, maybe we can learn from our Enterprise customers here a little bit because in our experience most of them we start with other few product managers or Dev managers who are actually spearheading all of the internal use case evangelism as well as product roadmap.',
"They're able to highly drawer get the right people.",
'They know who they need to discuss and win rate of persona of what an advocate really looks like an identified from A large community.',
'We already have a very huge Community because for Enterprise customers adding more and more ads ill every day.',
'So the Kill every day.',
'So the other identity that we select people from the community who are truly driving this organically, and they are passionate about building for Innovative products using our apis, and they are the right people to understand the charges while building a product because we are sometimes you might be thinking more platform perspective.',
'So having their view to me is has been very helpful to grow in these Enterprise.',
'Rises.',
'So Vikram, who do you want to consult exactly some of our customers you said?',
'So whatever that thing is, we create personas of The Advocates on our Enterprise customer side and then identify who is on our developer Community match who are similar behavioral and attitudinal qualities and their fan levels because we do not just want to have all the positive feedback.',
"We also want to get the feedback where it doesn't work with having the right balance of Skeptics.",
"And positive people in the mix would be the best thing to do and in an Enterprise organization we find both and it's The Advocates who are able to navigate those challenges much better.",
'So we want to understand Those challenges much better.',
'So we want to understand what that person looks like.',
'Yeah, I mean you could also argue that the Persona that you will have with these Enterprises inside of these Enterprises will be very different from the ones.',
'That will actually be Community drivers outside the Enterprises.',
'Do you know what I mean?',
'Yeah, yeah.',
'Yeah, no, no, totally not an apples to oranges.',
'But yeah, we will have to their close enough, but there are things that we need to select and deselect out of that.',
"The problem is that it's usually I mean the first step is never taken by an advocate within the Enterprise right?",
'But like when we build the advocacy, we want the first step to be taken by Advocates so it could be like a very different profile of people which is why I am like a little skeptical right now.',
"So Kunal, I think why don't you set up a follow-up conversation specifically with both the product and Technology team on this, and we can build deeper down into some of the examples that we could have inside our existing community and that try to replicate that.",
'Totally.',
"Yeah, I think that's a good starting point.",
'We really need to shift our Focus Hello Kitty, okay.',
'Yeah.',
'Yes.',
'Yes.',
'You were just like being up in the middle in between.',
"Yeah, I don't know.",
"I know what's happening.",
"You're breaking up a lot.",
"Yeah, I know at least hopefully you guys can see the transcription that's going on with what I am saying.",
'But yeah, we totally need to shift our focus more into our Dev, you know on the field of Advocates who can really help us grow with within their own circles.',
'Yeah.',
'So I will go ahead and I will set up a discussion with product.',
'Tmn the dev team.',
'Okay, that works.',
'Perfect.',
'What else Vikram I know you had a couple of other things on the agenda, so we can totally talk about that right now.',
'Okay.',
"Yeah, so the only other thing was as we're talking about employee growth I wanted to basically touch base with you and understand how we can or in which geographies we need to focus on the sales hires first because what and what would be the typical sort of profile side, but would be the most important would it be industry or would it be reasonable understanding because for example in a region like Europe there is there are multiple languages and Regional influences.",
"No influences, so should we focus on that or focus more on the industry and grow that way, so they're both strategies?",
'We can have a hybrid to but I wanted your thoughts on how do we think about hiding in those countries?',
'Yeah, so which are you talking about specific countries or you just talk about overall asia-pacific?',
'Mostly Europe, I think Asia Pacific we did discuss last time.',
'So I do have a more notes from symbol API',
"So would like to talk about Europe specifically if that's okay.",
'Yeah, sure.',
'So I when we were kind of like doing a discovery of locations in the I think in the last quarter of 2018, we wanted to make sure that we find Initial like come to Adventure skills company friendly locations in order to kind of like go companies and I think is in a very interesting or please just because the government supports a lot for growing companies there.',
'Also, I think if you hire more than x number of employees 50% off the salaries of each employee after that higher is actually provided by the government or the state.',
'So that makes it like very friendly for big companies to kind of like role there.',
'Plus.',
'There are all sorts of R&D tax credits that are provided for companies there?',
'We went on and partner.',
"And with cork Institute of Technology, although Dublin is supposed to be like one of the key hubs for multiple companies, but we found out that actually pork which is two hours from Dublin is very rich in talent and that is primarily because of the cork Institute of Technology's Ms. In Ai and machine learning.",
'So they have extremely high and valuable talent and a lot of people prefer to study in court as opposed to Dublin and just because of how expensive supplements to stay.',
'So we also actually got a couple of students just like met a couple of students while we were there.',
"R when you were doing this discovery to find out like what is their focus or what is their interest points and stuff and it seemed like there's great talented there.",
'So I definitely think that we must try.',
'To kind of hire a recruiting agency and just first it remotely you try to interview people right there and if it makes sense, and we get like let us just say that we are like 10 people who start with that can be a good start and if you would be you want I can also connect you with cork big which is basically an Institute that works with went to scale.',
'Companies to support growth with enough Ireland and I think they have a local community as well that I am familiar with.',
'So yeah, I am happy to do all of that.',
'So let us put together.',
"Can you work with the product because they have been specifically because that's really what we want to go there and ask them to put together a list of positions that we are looking for, and then we can work out how many people do we need to move from our current locations to the place?",
'And how many do we need to do fresh hires off and that can be a good starting point?',
'Yeah, that sounds good.',
'And we are actually participating in Mobile World Conference.',
'However, I do feel that with the Corona virus.',
'They might cancel it this year.',
"So we don't know, but we are going to represent it symbol in full for over there.",
"So we have plans to set up hiring discussion in one of the conference rooms as well as customer demos and the discussion, so we don't know if all the plans of an out, but I think it will be good to get the introduction with the Institute with recruitment.",
'And get sort of lined up some interviews in that time frame.',
'Yeah, sure.',
'Okay.',
'Yeah, I could totally do that.',
"Let me put together an introduction and meanwhile, why don't you work with the product and Dev team to put a list of positions that we want to get there?",
'So have you spoken to our general counsel already?',
'Cool.',
"So Kunal, why don't you work with Vikram and also to figure out if they can actually understand the space that we are in does that work for you?",
'Yeah.',
'Yeah, I was going to suggest that if Vikram you could admit to that meeting I can give some input as well from my experience with working with customers and who maybe we could on board.',
'Yeah, sure.',
'So I touched a little bit about my experience in the last two weeks working with.',
'Magpie who is one of our biggest customers.',
'So the Sprint cycle so far has been going pretty well.',
"We're really pushing behind the success with our own company and the growth that we're seeing the only issues that I am getting is that sometimes it becomes kind of difficult working with these other developers who don't have a whole lot of grasp on our product themselves and like there's a lot of catching up.",
"Up needed so it's hard to just jump into the project and get things completed.",
"So yeah, I don't know.",
'Do you guys have any suggestions on how we can make it there?',
'Are you talking about the developers on their side or the developers on our side?',
"A developers on their side who we're working with on implementing custom Solutions.",
'Oh are they not from the product being because we usually work with people the product even there are usually pretty intellectuals because they are building, right?',
'Yeah.',
'No, I mean they are part from the product team.',
"It's just and just in terms of Technology knowledge, you know at some points with some duct tapes that I am working with.",
"Its there's a little bit of Gap so that makes it kind of difficult sometimes.",
"I see Vikram you have some experience working with remote teams and specifically the customer Dean's right?",
'What?',
'So what is the best way to do like a gap analysis here?',
'Yeah Vikram.',
"I think that's the best idea.",
'I really like the hackathon idea because I know developers love that and especially if they get a chance to kind of explore our product not even in their own work environment, but kind of just in general for themselves.',
'That might be a really good push forward.',
'So.',
'Wow, okay.',
'So come to think of it.',
'We could maybe even make the scale this up a little bit and have developers, you know individual developers come to this hackathon work with us learn about our apis and our product and it might be a great way to kind of spread the word about us and get more user adoption.',
"Yeah, but we're not talking about that here.",
'Right?',
"We're talking more about friction getting Bridging the Gap with the customers that you're working with like the immediate customers right not from like a more customization.",
'Right, right.',
'Yeah.',
"No, that's definitely priority focusing on getting the Gap closed down.",
'Okay, so let us focus on that and like I want you to work with Vikram and figure out a plan in which we can make this hackathon work for our customers first, and then we should go out to the rest of the world.',
'Okay.',
'Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.',
'Yeah Vikram.',
'We should have a discussion about that after this tomorrow.',
'Perfect.',
'Okay, I will go ahead and schedule that.',
'Okay, guys, thank you.',
'I have to get going because I have another meeting right now.',
'And then yeah, I just I Vikram can you summarize all of this conversation that we had just had and send it over with all the important stuff that we all need to take care of?',
"Yeah, so just review and it is something that is just I don't do it and send it over please.",
'Okay.',
'Great.',
'Thank you.',
'Bye.hj',
'All right stand by.'
